This project is part of a small portfolio tool that allows a user to upload two CSV files, validate the data before submission, and store them on the server under a named portfolio. The frontend is built with React and MUI DataGrid to allow inline editing and validation, while the backend is a FastAPI service that handles file upload and storage.

Reasoning for tools:
Pydantic: Pydantic allows me to have strict control over the data structures being handled in the API, this also provides helpful error messages when data does not match expected structure.

SQL Alchemy: SQL ALchemy is an ORM with excellent tooling, with past experience I felt it was the perfect choice given how comfortable I am in using it and how simple it is to implement.

SQLite/Async: I utilised an async version of SQLite purely because it felt more natural when compared to my previous experience with live systems and databases.

Papa parse: Papa parse is a library that allows me to parse CSV FileObjects into arrays, this allowed me to then render and manipulate the data within before uploading to the server.

MUI/MUI DataGrid: I utilised MUI purely for inputs and buttons to prevent having to create my own, Inputs require extensive customisation and generalisation to work across the webapp, using a library here felt like the right choice. DataGrid was chosen for all the table rendering, this library provides all the necessary tooling to validate and manipulate table data.

Axios: Axios is a library I am very familiar with. I have used this library in production systems and understand its tooling well, it felt like the right choice here.

Brief Assumptions:
- A "User" must be able to upload... - I understood this as not only a user from an interaction perspective but also from a auth and application perspective, therefore I implemented an incredibly simple auth system using the bcrypt python library to create and compare password hashes to authenticate users.
- Portfolio management -  I assumed two things, 1: the user must be able to create a portfolio while following a specific workflow, 2: The user must be able to view other uploaded portfolios, hence why I implemented a table in the home page.

What would I improve?:
- Because of the DataGrid requiring strict and KNOWN column structures, I had to validate the columns directly using a method that had the column types predefined. This felt inefficent and rather messy, if I had more time, I would have liked to have figured out a more general way of doing this, if there is such a thing.
- While I was trying to show my front end skills in the FileUpload component, I realised that given the requirements on specific CSV files and column structures, I should have required a fixed upload method for a specific file type and name. I had committed myself to the FileUpload component structure early on and could not reasonably pivot upon realisation, especially given the work done at that point in time.
- Given the ability to upload practically any file the user wants with the help of the FileUpload component, the app can and will break to some degree if a file with the wrong structure or filename is provided. I would like to have spent more time validating column names to then determine that the CSV file is an expected structure, thereby disregarding the filename as irrelevant.
- I also would liked to have spent more time on the front end UI, I tried my best given the circumstances, but there is so much room for improvement (scss files being rushed, component structure not entirely modular, preview icon not switching to close etc)
- Server-side validation would have been ideal on the files uploaded, the ability to create a method within the PortfolioService class to validate the csv's and their structure to ensure that they are what is expected would have been a great validation approach.
